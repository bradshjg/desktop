# [GitHub Desktop -- Virtual Repos](https://desktop.github.com)

[GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) fork with experimental support for "virtual repos".

## Virtual Repos???

Virtual repos tries to capture the idea of a git repository that exists on an external filesystem.

This could be used when:

* Editing code over an SSH connection
* Using GitHub Codespaces

There are some pretty strong requirements for this to work, however. The most important being this only
implements the client side of the virtual repos, and the
[server side](https://github.com/bradshjg/gh-desktop-virtual-repo-server) (also available as a
[VS code extension](https://github.com/bradshjg/gh-desktop-virtual-repo-server-extension)) must be running on the
remote server (and the port `localhost:9195` must be resolve to that remove server...which can be a lot).

For example, to get this working over an SSH connection we'd need:

* A Node runtime on the remote server, and the server process running.
* A tunnel from `localhost:9195` to that remote Node process (e.g. using an SSH tunnel)

In GitHub Codespaces, it's _slightly_ simplified:

* Install the [extension](https://github.com/bradshjg/gh-desktop-virtual-repo-server-extension) and then run
  "GitHub Desktop: Start virtual repo server" which will launch the process and set up port forwarding.

The interface for adding a virtual repo is to use the path to the git repository on the remote file system. For
example if I'm working in a GitHub Codespace it might be something like `/workspaces/my-repo`.
