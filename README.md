# [GitHub Desktop -- Virtual Repos](https://desktop.github.com)

<<<<<<< HEAD
[GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) fork with experimental support for "virtual repos".
=======
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is an open source [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based
GitHub app. It is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and
uses [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Virtual Repos???

Virtual repos tries to capture the idea of a git repository that exists on an external filesystem.

This could be used when:

* Editing code over an SSH connection
* Using GitHub Codespaces

There are some pretty strong requirements for this to work, however. The most important being this only
implements the client side of the virtual repos, and the
[server side](https://github.com/bradshjg/gh-desktop-virtual-repo-server) (also available as a
[VS code extension](https://github.com/bradshjg/gh-desktop-virtual-repo-server-extension)) must be running on the
remote server (and the port `localhost:9195` must be resolve to that remote Node process...which can be a lot).

<<<<<<< HEAD
For example, to get this working over an SSH connection we'd need:

* A Node runtime on the remote server, and the server process running (and the build tools to build it, for now).
* A tunnel from `localhost:9195` to that remote Node process (e.g. using an SSH tunnel)
=======
Linux is not officially supported; however, you can find installers created for Linux from a fork of GitHub Desktop in the [Community Releases](https://github.com/desktop/desktop#community-releases) section.

**NOTE**: There is no current migration path to import your existing
repositories into the new application - you can drag-and-drop your repositories
from disk onto the application to get started.


### Beta Channel

In GitHub Codespaces, it's _slightly_ simplified:

* Install the [extension](https://github.com/bradshjg/gh-desktop-virtual-repo-server-extension) and then run
  "GitHub Desktop: Start virtual repo server" which will launch the process and set up port forwarding.

The interface for adding a virtual repo is to use the path to the git repository on the remote file system. For
example if I'm working in a GitHub Codespace it might be something like `/workspaces/my-repo`.

## Release Process

Currently a bit of a mess, but here it is:

1. `yarn build:prod`
2. `yarn package`
2. Follow [DMG build instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/create-a-disk-image-dskutl11888/mac).

Attach the generated DMG file to the release.


See our [getting started documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) for more information on how to set up, authenticate, and configure GitHub Desktop.
