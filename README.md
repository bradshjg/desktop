# [GitHub Desktop -- Virtual Repos](https://desktop.github.com)

[GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) fork with experimental support for "virtual repos".

## Virtual Repos???

Virtual repos tries to capture the idea of a git repository that exists on an external filesystem.

This could be used when:

* Editing code over an SSH connection
* Using GitHub Codespaces

### Configuring a virtual repo

Currently only `ssh`-based virtual repos are supported.

When adding a virtual repo, use

`ssh::<host>::<repo-path>`, e.g. `ssh::cs::/workspaces/desktop`

Where in this case `~/.ssh/config` includes

```
Host cs
  User codespace
  Hostname localhost
  Port 2222
  NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/ssh-%r@%h:%p
  ControlPersist 60m
```

It _must_ be the case that `ssh cs` (in this case) logs in without any need for user input, as this
is how commands are run on the remote host. To verify your config you can use:

`ssh cs echo howdy`

and ensure that `howdy` is returned without a password prompt or similar.

> N.B. The `ControlMaster`, `ControlPath`, `ControlPersist` sections allow multiplexing commands over
> a single TCP connection, vastly improving the usability!

## Release Process

Currently a bit of a mess, but here it is:

1. `yarn build:prod`
2. `yarn package`
2. Follow [DMG build instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/create-a-disk-image-dskutl11888/mac).

Attach the generated DMG file to the release.
